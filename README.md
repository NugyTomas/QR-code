### What I learned
This was my first solo project. I've had to look at positions again and it also came in handy to look at internet to solve some things.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

Now I would like to do next challenge from frontendmentor and get some feedback from more experienced people then me.
